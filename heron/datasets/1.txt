The pathology report describes a case with the chief concern of breast pathology, specifically involving the left breast. The surgical specimen received for analysis includes left breast tissue, a right simple mastectomy, and a right axilla sentinel node. The left breast tissue, indicative of macromastia, exhibits scattered foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia. The right breast shows moderately differentiated intraductal and infiltrating duct carcinoma with a Nottingham score of 7, comprising multifocal invasive foci, the largest measuring 7 mm. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present in 15 of 20 examined blocks. The report notes the absence of tumor in the nipple skin, random sections of remaining quadrants, and margins. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. A metastatic focus of breast carcinoma is found in the right axilla sentinel lymph node biopsy. The preliminary diagnosis suggests a case of synchronous primary breast carcinoma with a metastatic lesion in the sentinel lymph node. A diagnosis discrepancy is noted, and the case is marked for further evaluation.
