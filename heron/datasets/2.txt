The surgical pathology report describes a mastectomy specimen from the left breast of a patient. The tumor is identified as a moderately differentiated infiltrating lobular carcinoma with a Nottingham Score of 6 out of 9. The tumor size is measured at 3.5 cm, and no tumor necrosis or venous/lymphatic invasion is identified. Margins are negative, and the distance of the tumor from the nearest inked tissue edge is 0.5 cm. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present as an intraductal component. The nipple and skin involvement are not detected. One sentinel lymph node is negative for metastasis. Estrogen receptors are positive (95% nuclear staining), progesterone receptors are negative, and HER2/NEU is weakly positive by immunohistochemistry but negative by FISH. The pathologic stage is pT2 N0 MX. Additional pathologic changes include usual ductal hyperplasia, fibroadenomatoid change, fibrocystic changes, and changes at the prior biopsy site. The report notes that microscopic foci of infiltrating lobular carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ in a random section likely represent extensions of the main tumor rather than true multifocal carcinoma. The gross description provides details on the mastectomy specimen, including the size, location of the tumor, and the absence of nipple and skin involvement. The clinical diagnosis and history are not provided in the report.
