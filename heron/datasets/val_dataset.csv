/content/heron/heron/datasets/4.png,"The surgical pathology report pertains to a right breast needle localization biopsy (Specimen # not provided) for a female patient. The final diagnosis indicates the presence of multifocal infiltrating lobular carcinoma, well-to-moderately differentiated, with an estimated tumor size of 2.8 cm in the largest dimension. Immunostains for hormone receptors reveal positive estrogen receptors (70% of cells, strong staining) and positive progesterone receptors (30% of cells, strong staining). The HER2 status is initially reported as 2+ by Herceptest, with FISH pending. An addendum later states that the HER2 FISH result is 1.4, indicating non-amplification. The clinical diagnosis suggests ruling out breast cancer. The gross description details the specimen as fibrofatty tissue with a needle localization wire, measuring 6.3 x 4.4 x 1.5 cm. The tissue is multifocal, present on seven consecutive sections. The report concludes with information about the sections in cassettes and pairs representing sections from the same tissue plane.
