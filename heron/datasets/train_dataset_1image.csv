/content/heron/heron/datasets/2.png,"The pathology report reveals a discrepancy in the diagnosis criteria. The patient has a history of prior malignancy, and the final pathologic diagnosis indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of two right axillary sentinel lymph nodes. The right breast shows invasive micropapillary carcinoma (2.1 cm) associated with microcalcifications, atypical lobular hyperplasia, fibroadenoma, and benign ductal microcalcifications. The tumor has a modified Bloom-Richardson grade of 2, with a total score of 7 points. No lymphatic-vascular or perineural invasion is identified, and resection margins are negative. The lymph node status indicates one positive out of six sampled, with a maximum metastasis diameter of 2.1 mm and an AJCC/UICC stage of pT2N1aMx. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors are positive, while the HER2/neu test is negative. An intraoperative consultation confirms the absence of carcinoma in the right axillary sentinel lymph node #1. The gross description details the received specimens, and additional comments mention a consensus agreement on the diagnosis. Other specimens from the right axillary contents and right breast core biopsies indicate no malignancy.
