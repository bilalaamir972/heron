"/home/cognimindai2/Documents/Patholgy_Report/Dataset_Finetuning/images/2.png,""The pathology report reveals a discrepancy in the diagnosis criteria. The patient has a history of prior malignancy, and the final pathologic diagnosis indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of two right axillary sentinel lymph nodes. The right breast shows invasive micropapillary carcinoma (2.1 cm) associated with microcalcifications, atypical lobular hyperplasia, fibroadenoma, and benign ductal microcalcifications. The tumor has a modified Bloom-Richardson grade of 2, with a total score of 7 points. No lymphatic-vascular or perineural invasion is identified, and resection margins are negative. The lymph node status indicates one positive out of six sampled, with a maximum metastasis diameter of 2.1 mm and an AJCC/UICC stage of pT2N1aMx. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors are positive, while the HER2/neu test is negative. An intraoperative consultation confirms the absence of carcinoma in the right axillary sentinel lymph node #1. The gross description details the received specimens, and additional comments mention a consensus agreement on the diagnosis. Other specimens from the right axillary contents and right breast core biopsies indicate no malignancy."""
"/home/cognimindai2/Documents/Patholgy_Report/Dataset_Finetuning/images/3.png,""The pathology report describes a case with the chief concern of breast pathology, specifically involving the left breast. The surgical specimen received for analysis includes left breast tissue, a right simple mastectomy, and a right axilla sentinel node. The left breast tissue, indicative of macromastia, exhibits scattered foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia. The right breast shows moderately differentiated intraductal and infiltrating duct carcinoma with a Nottingham score of 7, comprising multifocal invasive foci, the largest measuring 7 mm. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present in 15 of 20 examined blocks. The report notes the absence of tumor in the nipple skin, random sections of remaining quadrants, and margins. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. A metastatic focus of breast carcinoma is found in the right axilla sentinel lymph node biopsy. The preliminary diagnosis suggests a case of synchronous primary breast carcinoma with a metastatic lesion in the sentinel lymph node. A diagnosis discrepancy is noted, and the case is marked for further evaluation."""
"/home/cognimindai2/Documents/Patholgy_Report/Dataset_Finetuning/images/1.png,""The surgical pathology report describes a mastectomy specimen from the left breast of a patient. The tumor is identified as a moderately differentiated infiltrating lobular carcinoma with a Nottingham Score of 6 out of 9. The tumor size is measured at 3.5 cm, and no tumor necrosis or venous/lymphatic invasion is identified. Margins are negative, and the distance of the tumor from the nearest inked tissue edge is 0.5 cm. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present as an intraductal component. The nipple and skin involvement are not detected. One sentinel lymph node is negative for metastasis. Estrogen receptors are positive (95% nuclear staining), progesterone receptors are negative, and HER2/NEU is weakly positive by immunohistochemistry but negative by FISH. The pathologic stage is pT2 N0 MX. Additional pathologic changes include usual ductal hyperplasia, fibroadenomatoid change, fibrocystic changes, and changes at the prior biopsy site. The report notes that microscopic foci of infiltrating lobular carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ in a random section likely represent extensions of the main tumor rather than true multifocal carcinoma. The gross description provides details on the mastectomy specimen, including the size, location of the tumor, and the absence of nipple and skin involvement. The clinical diagnosis and history are not provided in the report."""
